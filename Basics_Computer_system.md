# **Basics of Computer System**
**Digital Computers**
>The word digital implies that the information in the computer is represented by variables that take a limited number of discrete values. In practice, digital computers work reliably if only two states are used, because of physical restrictions and human logic tends to be bianry(Yes or No, True or False).
>A binary digit is called a bit. 

**Program**
>A sequence of instructions for the computer is called a Program.

**Computer Organization**
>It is concerned with the way the hardware components operate and the way they are connected together to form the computer system.

**Computer Design**
>It is concerned with the hardware design of the computer.

**Computer Architecture**
>It is concerned with the structure and behaviour of the computer as seen by the user. It includes the information, the instruction set, and techniques for adressing memory. The architectural design of a computer system is concerned with the specifications of various functional modules, such as processors and memmories, and structuring them together in a computer system.

>Two basic types architecture are : 
>1. von Neumann Architecutre: _Von Neumann Architecture is a digital computer architecture whose design is based on the concept of stored program computers where program data and instruction data are stored in the same memory. This principle holds that data, as well as the instructions used to manipulate that data, should be stored in the same memory area of the computer and instructions are carried out sequentially, one instruction at a time. This imposes a sort of "speed limit" on program execution, since only on instruction at a time can be handled by the computer's processor. It means that the CPU can be either reading an instruction or reading/writing data from/to the memory. Both cannot occur at the same time since the instructions and data use the same signal pathways and memory. Eg.: PC(Personal Computers)_

>2. Harvard Architecutre: _Harvard Architecture is the computer architecture that contains separate storage and separate buses (signal path) for instruction and data. It was basically developed to overcome the bottleneck of Von Neumann Architecture. The main advantage of having separate buses for instruction and data is that the CPU can access instructions and read/write data at the same time. Eg.: Microcontrollers & DSP(Digital Signal Processors)_

**Logic Gates**
> - Binary information is represented in digital computers by physical quantities called signals. Electrical signals such as voltages exist throughout the computer in either one of two recognizable states. The two states represent a binary variable that can be equal to 1 or 0.
> - Binary logic deals with binary variables and with operations that assume a logical meaning. It is used to describe, in algebraic or tabular form, the manipulation and processing of binary information. The manipulation of binary information is done by logic circuits called gates. Gates are blocks of hardware that produce signals of binary 1 or 0 when input logic requirements are satisfied. A variety of logic gates are commonly used in digital computer systems.
